                <img src="images/glanceback/2024-01-23.png" alt="When is my hair going to grow back">
                <br>
                <p3>Before school started back during winter break, I was going through a mental life crisis on whether cutting my hair for the new year 2024 would mean a new year for me. As days passed through the first weeks of being back, I started to regret chopping off my hair. I've grown used to the new hairstyle, but I still miss my dreads.</p3>

                <img src="images/glanceback/2024-01-25.png" alt="Think of how to delete the photo">
                <br>
                <p4>I was still getting used to the glance-back photos. Still, I wasn't prepared for when it took pictures of me, so when it started taking a photo of me, I became irritated because I wasn't prepared.</p4>

                <img src="images/glanceback/2024-01-29.png" alt="How to download glance photos">
                <br>
                <p5>As simple as it is downloading photos from Glance-Back, I still couldn't understand where to go to download photos even though it's literally right in your face when you open your browser with Glance-back.</p5>

            <div>
                <img src="images/glanceback/2024-01-30.png" alt="Why does it keep taking bad photos of me?">
                <br>
                <p6>Again, the ops of Glance-Back has caught me lacking again. I was just wondering when will I ever be ready for Glance-Back to take a picture of me.</p6>

                <img src="images/glanceback/2024-02-25.png" alt="Why is '2024' by playboicarti such a vibe?">
                <br>
                <p7>You ever wake up in the morning and look at your notifications just to see that playboicarti dropped another classical song. This was what I was thinking after listening to '2024' by playboicarti on my way to work.</p7>

                <img src="images/glanceback/2024-02-27.png" alt="Why is Supreme's upcoming Thursday drop so fire?">
                <br>
                <p8>Supreme recently dropped a collaboration with NorthFace that featured Split Taped Seam Shell Jacket that's waterproof which allows you switch out and mix & match different jackets for your own style choice. This was the highlight of my day when Supreme dropped the jacket. I am planning to get multiple of those jackets in a size XL.</p8>
