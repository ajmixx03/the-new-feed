        <h3>What do you usually use the internet for the most?</h3>
        <p1>I usually use the internet for shopping, fashion news, research, school, and social media. I'm always looking for new clothes to buy literally every chance I get. But, when I'm not buying clothes, I'm looking at the most recent runway collections from different fashion brands. And normally, I'm using it for homework, research, and social media. </p1>

        <h3>My screenshot reflections </h3>
        <p2>Through the process of Glance back taking screenshots of my face, all the screenshots happened when I first opened my Chrome browser, but never when I was searching for something on the browser. So, whenever it took a screenshot of me, I always just typed something I was thinking at that moment. For instance, my first screenshot was of when I cut my hair and wasn't used to it, so I reflected on how I regretted cutting my hair off. And for most of them, I just reflected on how I felt in that moment. I didn't get the chance to explore the internet while having Glance back take a photo of me.</p2>

        <h3>What could my own website be?</h3>
        <p3>You're probably reading this and thinking about many creative websites you could create. The first thing that pops into my mind is making a fashion website for my future brand or someone else. Somewhat like the old layout of Off-White's website when Virgil Abloh still worked there before his passing, and how interactive his website was, so it was exciting to stare at. I also admired the layout of the website because how it had some aspects of an unfinished website yet still had a clean finishâ€”it reminded me of all the code and numbers that would appear in the movie 'The Matrix.' I would create a website with that much creativity that it creates a whole experience other than just shopping.</p3>

        <p4>You can think that the internet is going to grow one way and it ends up going the complete opposite direction. The internet is unpredictable and you know how it's going to change.</p4>

        <h4>Touching some grass</h4>
        <p5>For my touching some grass site page, I had to go outside to take photos of the world around me create a site page to showcase what I experienced. Life online in contrast to in real life are two completely different experience. It's one thing to see something online a say to yourself "Wow, that's so beautiful! I wish I could be there!" and actually getting the full experience of life itself. It's almost impossible to even put into words the actual experience of seeing the world in person compared to seeing a picture or video online.</p5>
